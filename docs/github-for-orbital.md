# What is GitHub?

To quote [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub):
> GitHub is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. It is mostly used for computer code. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.

Basically, it's your best friend when it comes to writing, sharing, and maintaining code. Here are some of the basics of our GitHub Organization page.

## The Home Page

![Home_Page](https://github.com/kcsodetz/Git-for-Orbital/blob/master/docs/assets/Home_Page_Labeled.jpg)

The Home Page can always be found at https://github.com/purdue-orbital. This is where all of Purdue Orbital's repositories are stored, and where you will go to create new repositories to upload. **Arrow 1** shows the location of the _New Repository_ button and **Arrow 2** shows some repositories currently present on the page. Instructions on creating a new repository can be found [here](#creating-a-new-repository).

## Getting a Repository
There are a few ways to get a repository on your local machine: __Cloning__ and __Forking__. While both accomplish the same thing, they are both used for different reasons.

_Cloning_ is the best method if:
* You just want to get the code on your computer and run it
* You just want to follow along and get the updates for the project when they are available
* You are planning to push your own changes to that particular project
* You plan to edit without adding to the project
* You don't want the owner to know you've copied the code and remain anonymous

_Forking_ is the best method if:
* You want your own version of the code to rename, mess around with, and edit
* You want to make changes that don't go on the project page
* You want to add it to your personal GitHub account

Whichever method you use, you'll end up with the project on your local machine, ready for you to run and play around with. 
Keep in mind that forking is __public__, and everyone will be able to see that you've done it. The rule of thumb is: When in doubt, just clone the project.

### Cloning or Forking a Repository

![Cloning a Repo](https://github.com/kcsodetz/Git-for-Orbital/blob/master/docs/assets/Repository_Clone.jpg)

This is the page for an individual repository. It contains all the files and directories for the project, as well as the number of commits, branches, and contributors. Clicking any file name shows the code in its raw form. __Arrow 1__ is the button for cloning the repository, and __Arrow 2__ is the link to copy in order to clone the repository. 

__Arrow 3__ is where you fork a repository to your personal GitHub. Once you fork the repository, navigate to your personal page, and follow the steps above to clone the repository.

### Creating a New Repository

![Home_Page](https://github.com/kcsodetz/Git-for-Orbital/blob/master/image_src/Home_Page_Labeled.jpg)

As stated before, **Arrow 1** shows the location of the _New Repository_ button and **Arrow 2** shows some repositories currently present on the page. Click the button shown by **Arrow 1** to begin creating a new repository.

![New_Repo_Page](https://github.com/purdue-orbital/Git-for-Orbital/blob/master/docs/assets/Create_New_Repo.JPG)

You'll be greeted with this page. Go ahead and give your repository a name (if the name has multiple words, then use dashes '-' instead of spaces or underscores), a description, and always make the repository public. You can choose to add a README (set of instructions on how to use the contents of the repository), and simply click "Create Repository" to finalize.
#### Empty GitHub Repository

Once you create an empty repository, you'll be greeted with this page. Don't worry, it looks complicated, but it's not too bad once you get the hang of it. __Just copy the link shown by the red arrow and save it for later. This crucial for adding code in the future!__ Congrats! You have created a repository on the Purdue Orbital page.

## Closing Remarks
Now that you have a fresh repository, you can now begin to add your code for everyone to view, contribute to, and download. To learn how to add your code to GitHub, go to the [Adding to the Organization](./adding-to-orbital.html) page.
